Matthew Lewis,The Monk,"'He was deaf to the murmurs of conscience, and resolved to satisfy his desires at any price.' The Monk (1796) is a sensational story of temptation and depravity, a masterpiece of Gothic fiction and the first horror novel in English literature. The respected monk Ambrosio, the Abbot of a Capuchin monastery in Madrid, is overwhelmed with desire for a young girl; once having abandoned his monastic vows he begins a terrible descent into immorality and violence. His appalling fall from grace embraces blasphemy, black magic, torture, rape, and murder, and places his very soul in jeopardy. Lewis's extraordinary tale drew on folklore, legendary ghost stories, and contemporary dread inspired by the terrors of the French Revolution. Its excesses shocked the reading public and it was condemned as obscene. The novel continues to beguile and shock readers today with its gruesome catalogue of iniquities, while at the same time giving a profound insight into the deep anxieties experienced by British citizens during one of the most turbulent periods in the nation's history.

Robert R. McCammon,Boy's Life,"An Alabama boy’s innocence is shaken by murder and madness in the 1960s South in this novel by the New York Times–bestselling author of Swan Song. It’s 1964 in idyllic Zephyr, Alabama. People either work for the paper mill up the Tecumseh River, or for the local dairy. It’s a simple life, but it stirs the impressionable imagination of twelve-year-old aspiring writer Cory Mackenson. He’s certain he’s sensed spirits whispering in the churchyard. He’s heard of the weird bootleggers who lurk in the dark outside of town. He’s seen a flood leave Main Street crawling with snakes. Cory thrills to all of it as only a young boy can. Then one morning, while accompanying his father on his milk route, he sees a car careen off the road and slowly sink into fathomless Saxon’s Lake. His father dives into the icy water to rescue the driver, and finds a beaten corpse, naked and handcuffed to the steering wheel—a copper wire tightened around the stranger’s neck. In time, the townsfolk seem to forget all about the unsolved murder. But Cory and his father can’t. Their search for the truth is a journey into a world where innocence and evil collide. What lies before them is the stuff of fear and awe, magic and madness, fantasy and reality. As Cory wades into the deep end of Zephyr and all its mysteries, he’ll discover that while the pleasures of childish things fade away, growing up can be a strange and beautiful ride. “Strongly echoing the childhood-elegies of King and Bradbury, and every bit their equal,” Boy’s Life, a winner of both the Bram Stoker and World Fantasy Awards, represents a brilliant blend of mystery and rich atmosphere, the finest work of one of today’s most accomplished writers (Kirkus Reviews).",5,Open Road Media,582,1453231560,horror,/copertina libri/boysLife.jpg,30,È possibile estendere il prestito per altri 30 giorni.

A New York Times bestseller, it received the prestigious Stoker Award from the Horror Writers Association. On a cold October night, five people gather in a run-down motel on the New Jersey shore and begin preparations to break in to the Paragon Hotel. Built in the glory days of Asbury Park by a reclusive millionaire, the magnificent structure—which foreshadowed the beauties of art-deco architecture—is now boarded up and marked for demolition. The five people are ""creepers,"" the slang term for urban explorers: city archeologists with a passion for investigating abandoned buildings and their dying secrets. On this evening, they are joined by a reporter who wants to profile them—anonymously, as this is a highly illegal activity—for a New York Times article. Frank Balenger isn't looking for just a story, however. And after the group enters the rat-infested tunnel leading to the hotel, it becomes clear that he will get much more than he bargained for.

Less From the master of high action comes a novel of deception and intrigue that paved the way for the history-based religious thrillers of Dan Brown, Steve Berry, and James Rollins. In 1244, at the infamous fortress of Montségur in southwestern France, Christian Inquisitors massacred the last vestige of a heresy known as Mithraism, once the dominant religion of the Roman Empire. But was the heresy in fact destroyed? In today’s New York City, reporter Tess Drake discovers a mysterious altar in the apartment of a friend whose charred body was discovered in a nearby park. The altar (a version of it exists in the British Museum) depicts a man astride a bull, plunging a knife into its neck while a dog, a scorpion, and a snake drink the blood.

David Morrell,First Blood,"From New York Times bestselling author, David Morrell, comes a classic thriller that introduced the character of Rambo, one of the most iconic action heroes of the twentieth century. Called “the father of the modern action novel,” FIRST BLOOD changed the genre. Although the book and the film adaptation have similarities, they are very different, especially its unexpected ending and its greater intensity. If you’ve only experienced the film, you’re in for a surprise. Once they were soldiers. Rambo, the ragged kid whose presence in town is considered a threat. And Teasle, the Chief of Police of Madison, Kentucky. Both have been trained to kill: Rambo in Vietnam, Teasle in Korea. They learned different military tactics, different ways of death and survival in two different wars. Now, without warning, they are enemies in a civilian combat that becomes a chase through the woods and mountains and caves above the town. As we follow them, we understand that once a man has been trained as a killer, perhaps he is changed forever. Award-winning FIRST BLOOD was published in 1972, was translated into 26 languages, and has never been out of print. It was one of the first novels to deal with post-traumatic stress disorder. David’s novelizations for RAMBO (FIRST BLOOD PART II) and RAMBO III are available as e-books. They’re quite different from the films and include revealing introductions. See also David’s RAMBO AND ME: THE STORY BEHIND THE STORY. Critical reactions: “A fine novel. . . . When Johnny comes marching home this time, watch out.” —The New York Times Sunday Book Review “A first-rate thriller.” —Newsweek “One of the finest chase novels you will ever read.” —Minneapolis Tribune “A terrific thriller.” —Saturday Review “One hell of a hard, fast novel.” —John D.

SUMMER 2018 PUBLISHERS WEEKLY PICK! “A tremendous book―thought-provoking and terrifying, with tension that winds up like a chain. The Cabin at the End of the World is Tremblay’s personal best. It’s that good.” — Stephen King “A clinic in suspense, a story that opens with high-wire tension and never lets up from there.” — Michael Koryta ""I tore through it in record time. I just couldn’t wait to see where Tremblay was going to take me next.” — Victor LaValle The Bram Stoker Award-winning author of A Head Full of Ghosts adds an inventive twist to the home invasion horror story in a heart-palpitating novel of psychological suspense that recalls Stephen King’s Misery, Ruth Ware’s In a Dark, Dark Wood, and Jack Ketchum’s cult hit The Girl Next Door. Seven-year-old Wen and her parents, Eric and Andrew, are vacationing at a remote cabin on a quiet New Hampshire lake. Their closest neighbors are more than two miles in either direction along a rutted dirt road. One afternoon, as Wen catches grasshoppers in the front yard, a stranger unexpectedly appears in the driveway. Leonard is the largest man Wen has ever seen but he is young, friendly, and he wins her over almost instantly. Leonard and Wen talk and play until Leonard abruptly apologizes and tells Wen, ""None of what’s going to happen is your fault"". Three more strangers then arrive at the cabin carrying unidentifiable, menacing objects. As Wen sprints inside to warn her parents, Leonard calls out: ""Your dads won’t want to let us in, Wen. But they have to. We need your help to save the world."" Thus begins an unbearably tense, gripping tale of paranoia, sacrifice, apocalypse, and survival that escalates to a shattering conclusion, one in which the fate of a loving family and quite possibly all of humanity are entwined. The Cabin at the End of the World is a masterpiece of terror and suspense from the fantastically fertile imagination of Paul Tremblay. “Read Paul Tremblay's new novel, The Cabin at the End of the World, and you might not sleep for a week. Longer. It will shape your nightmares for months – that's pretty much guaranteed.” — NPR “Gripping, horrifying, and mesmerizing.” — GQ “A tour-de-force of psychological and religious horror.” — BN.com “A blinding tale of survival and sacrifice.” — Kirkus Reviews “Tremblay has a real winner here.” — Tor.com",5,HarperCollins,288,62679120,horror,/copertina libri/TheCabinAtTheEndOfTheWorld.jpg,30,È possibile estendere il prestito per altri 30 giorni.

Daniel Defoe,Robinson Crusoe,"Robinson Crusoe is one of the most famous literary characters in history, and his story has spawned hundreds of retellings. Inspired by the life of Alexander Selkirk, a sailor who lived for several years on a Pacific island, the novel tells the story of Crusoe’s survival after shipwreck on an island, interaction with the mainland’s native inhabitants, and eventual rescue. Read variously as economic fable, religious allegory, or imperialist fantasy, Crusoe has never lost its appeal as one of the most compelling adventure stories of all time. In addition to an introduction and helpful notes, this Broadview Edition includes a wide range of appendices that situate Defoe’s 1719 novel amidst castaway narratives, economic treatises, reports of cannibalism, explorations of solitude, and Defoe’s own writings on slavery and the African trade. A final appendix presents images of Crusoe’s rescue of Friday from a dozen of the most significant illustrated editions of the novel published between 1719 and 1920.",5,Broadview Press,422,1770482245,avventura,/copertina libri/RobinsonCrusoe.jpg,30,È possibile estendere il prestito per altri 30 giorni.
Jon Krakauer,Nelle terre estreme,"IL LIBRO CULT DA CUI È STATO TRATTO INTO THE WILD. Nell’aprile del 1992 Chris McCandless si incamminò da solo negli immensi spazi selvaggi dell’Alaska. Due anni prima, terminati gli studi, aveva abbandonato tutti i suoi averi e donato i suoi risparmi in beneficenza: voleva lasciare la civiltà per immergersi nella natura. Non adeguatamente equipaggiato, senza alcuna preparazione alle condizioni estreme che avrebbe incontrato, venne ritrovato morto da un cacciatore, quattro mesi dopo la sua partenza per le terre a nord del Monte McKinley. Accanto al cadavere fu rinvenuto un diario che Chris aveva inaugurato al suo arrivo in Alaska e che ha permesso di ricostruire le sue ultime settimane. Jon Krakauer si imbatté quasi per caso in questa vicenda, rimanendone quasi ossessionato, e scrisse un lungo articolo sulla rivista «Outside» che suscitò enorme interesse. In seguito, con l’aiuto della famiglia di Chris, si è dedicato alla ricostruzione del lungo viaggio del ragazzo: due anni attraverso l’America all’inseguimento di un sogno. Questo libro, in cui Krakauer cerca di capire cosa può aver spinto Chris a ricercare uno stato di purezza assoluta a contatto con una natura incontaminata, è il risultato di tre anni di ricerche. Ma «Nelle terre estreme», però, non è solo la ricostruzione degli eventi che portarono Chris McCandless alla morte, è anche una metafora sul rapporto tra la nostra civiltà e la natura che la circonda, è un formidabile tentativo di penetrare le segrete vibrazioni che percorrono tutte le giovinezze, è un viaggio del corpo e dell’anima scritto da un maestro del racconto d’avventura che qui si mette in gioco lasciandosi coinvolgere – assieme al lettore – dalle figure eroiche di cui narra.",5,Corbaccio,274,8863800936,avventura,/copertina libri/NelleTerreEstreme.jpg,30,È possibile estendere il prestito per altri 30 giorni.
Jon Krakauer,Into the Wild,"In April 1992 a young man from a well-to-do family hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. His name was Christopher Johnson McCandless. He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, his decomposed body was found by a moose hunter. How McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of Into the Wild. Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and , unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented. Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw the maps away. Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild. Jon Krakauer constructs a clarifying prism through which he reassembles the disquieting facts of McCandless's short life. Admitting an interst that borders on obsession, he searches for the clues to the dries and desires that propelled McCandless. Digging deeply, he takes an inherently compelling mystery and unravels the larger riddles it holds: the profound pull of the American wilderness on our imagination; the allure of high-risk activities to young men of a certain cast of mind; the complex, charged bond between fathers and sons. When McCandless's innocent mistakes turn out to be irreversible and fatal, he becomes the stuff of tabloid headlines and is dismissed for his naiveté, pretensions, and hubris. He is said to have had a death wish but wanting to die is a very different thing from being compelled to look over the edge. Krakauer brings McCandless's uncompromising pilgrimage out of the shadows, and the peril, adversity , and renunciation sought by this enigmatic young man are illuminated with a rare understanding--and not an ounce of sentimentality. Mesmerizing, heartbreaking, Into the Wild is a tour de force. The power and luminosity of Jon Krakauer's stoytelling blaze through every page.

Anna Banti,Zanna Bianca,"Zanna Bianca, il protagonista del romanzo, è l’unico di quattro cuccioli che riesce a sopravvivere in una grotta dello Yukon, sopra un torrente, lontano da ovunque. Dentro la tana inaccessibile, il piccolo lupo viene al mondo generato da colei che viene semplicemente presentata come ‘la lupa’ e la prima parte del libro lascia in questa sospensione il lettore per condurlo sulla pista dei valori ‘primordiali’, senza nomi e cognomi. È come se London volesse sfruttare un archetipo e i suoi simboli; solo in seguito scopriamo che ‘la lupa’ è Kiche, figlia di un lupo e di un cane, una femmina agguerrita e astuta, già di proprietà del capotribù Castoro Grigio. […] Zanna Bianca nasce nel Wild e nasce lupo con dentro il codice genetico del cane: quest’altro archetipo alla fine prevarrà dopo una lunga storia formativa fatta di durezza e amore, rinuncia e crudeltà. Anche il padre di Zanna Bianca è un archetipo, ma il vecchio lupo grigio Occhio Solo, sopravvissuto a mille battaglie e alla furia della natura selvaggia, diventa il simbolo della vita che sopravvive a se stessa, del Wild che scorre dalle generazioni che lo hanno preceduto a quelle future.",5,Giunti Junior,150,8809754042,avventura,/copertina libri/ZannaBianca.jpg,30,È possibile estendere il prestito per altri 30 giorni.
Mark Twain,Le avventure di Huckleberry Finn,"“La storia di Huck e della sua fuga in zattera lungo il Mississippi con il negro Jim, fino al ricongiungimento col compagno di scorrerie Tom Sawyer negli ultimi capitoli di un libro che nacque come proseguimento del precedente Le avventure di Tom Sawyer era tra le preferite di Ernest Hemingway, che citava sempre Mark Twain tra i suoi autori fondamentali: e non a caso, naturalmente, visto che fin dai suoi esordi anche l’autore di Fiesta lavorò molto duramente per riuscire a ricreare sulla pagina la lingua della strada, cosa per cui venne assai criticato. Molti, tra cui Joyce Carol Oates, considerano Le avventure di Huckleberry Finn “Il Grande Romanzo Americano”. Altri, come Thomas Stearns Eliot, lo considerano l’unico vero capolavoro di Mark Twain. Di sicuro Le avventure di Huckleberry Finn è un romanzo-mondo, scritto superbamente, e divertentissimo. Huck Finn, in quanto ribelle adolescente refrattario a qualsiasi forma di autorità e di imposizione, sta all’origine di Holden Caulfield e di tutti i ribelli adolescenti della letteratura nordamericana. E il fiume Mississippi, che Twain conobbe a fondo in gioventù per averci lavorato come pilota su un battello, è al tempo stesso uno dei protagonisti principali del libro e una metafora. Ma la storia di Huck Finn e del suo lungo viaggio, al termine del quale l’ormai ex ragazzino verrà a sapere della morte del padre e però subito progetterà di ripartire con i suoi compagni d’avventura (questa volta per i Territori Indiani) è anche una grande satira sulla democrazia americana e sugli americani, in genere timorati di Dio ma sempre felici di impiccare un negro (e quando si parla di leggi razziali bisognerebbe ricordarsi ogni volta di aggiungere che gli Stati Uniti d’America hanno mantenuto le loro fino alla seconda metà del Novecento).”(dall’Introduzione di Giuseppe Culicchia)",5,Feltrinelli Editore,284,8807943980,avventura,/copertina libri/HuckFinn.jpg,30,È possibile estendere il prestito per altri 30 giorni.

Patrick O'Brian,Costa sottovento,"Per Jack Aubrey, capitano di fregata della Royal Navy nei primissimi anni dell'Ottocento, al tempo in cui l'Europa è travolta dal turbine di Napoleone, la vera dimensione della vita è sul mare, tra rande, scotte, fiocchi, controvelacci e controvelaccini. Lo sa bene anche il suo amico Stephen Maturin, medico di bordo, un autentico dottor sottile, marinaio per caso e suo malgrado, che ha condiviso con lui ogni avventura. I due, ora che Aubrey è privo di un comando, affittano una residenza nella campagna inglese, dove vivono come tranquilli gentiluomini, tra una caccia alla volpe e una serata musicale. La vita sulla terraferma presenta però insidie assai più temibili di quelle che si possono incontrare sulle navi, specie quando si materializzano nelle attraenti forme di due deliziose fanciulle che fanno breccia nel loro cuore e, nel contempo, creano qualche malinteso nei loro rapporti. Poiché i guai non arrivano mai soli, un grave problema di debiti (mentre Aubrey pensa di essere in credito con la fortuna) costringe i due a una fuga rocambolesca, davvero sotto mentite spoglie. Ma il mare reclama i suoi diritti, e Jack, sventato persino un possibile ammutinamento, si coprirà di gloria contro i francesi e gli spagnoli, prima a bordo della Polychrest (una strana corvetta che sembra stare a galla per scommessa e affonderà senza troppi rimpianti da parte di nessuno) e poi, ottenuta la tanto sospirata promozione, della Lively, una vera e propria signora degli oceani... Dopo il successo di Primo comando, Patrick O'Brian si conferma in questo libro autore di straordinario interesse, non solo per la consueta, minuziosa attenzione ai particolari storici, per la resa tecnicamente ineccepibile degli scontri navali, ma soprattutto per la capacità di ricostruire l'ambiente della marina nell'epoca gloriosa dei velieri, per le intense descrizioni di paesaggio e per l'abilità - sorretta da un umorismo sempre puntuale e garbato, che più inglese di così non si potrebbe - con cui sa restituire la complessa e delicata tessitura psicologica dei personaggi, in particolare quelli femminili.",5,Longanesi,475,8830430102,avventura,/copertina libri/CostaSottovento.jpg,30,È possibile estendere il prestito per altri 30 giorni.
Giorgio Parra,Manuale di ancoraggio,"Un buon ancoraggio è di fondamentale importanza per dormire sonni tranquilli.

Aldous Huxley,Brave New World,"Huxley's bleak future prophesized in Brave New World was a capitalist civilization which had been reconstituted through scientific and psychological engineering, a world in which people are genetically designed to be passive and useful to the ruling class. Satirical and disturbing, Brave New World is set some 600 years ahead, in ""this year of stability, A.F. 632""--the A.F. standing for After Ford, meaning the godlike Henry Ford. ""Community, Identity, Stability,"" is the motto. Reproduction is controlled through genetic engineering, and people are bred into a rigid class system. As they mature, they are conditioned to be happy with the roles that society has created for them. The rest of their lives are devoted to the pursuit of pleasure through sex, recreational sports, the getting and having of material possessions, and taking a drug called Soma. Concepts such as family, freedom, love, and culture are considered grotesque. Against this backdrop, a young man known as John the Savage is brought to London from the remote desert of New Mexico. What he sees in the new civilization a ""brave new world"" (quoting Shakespeare's The Tempest). However, ultimately, John challenges the basic premise of this society in an act that threatens and fascinates its citizens. Huxley uses his entire prowess to throw the idea of utopia into reverse, presenting us what is known as the ""dystopian"" novel. When Brave New World was written (1931), neither Hitler nor Stalin had risen to power. Huxley saw the enduring threat to society from the dark side of scientific and social progress, and mankind's increasing appetite for simple amusement. Brave New World is a work that indicts the idea of progress for progress sake and is backed up with force and reason.",5,RosettaBooks,288,795311257,fantascienza,/copertina libri/BraveNewWorld.jpg,30,È possibile estendere il prestito per altri 30 giorni.

When the ten-year-old Kerryl Ryson creates an unseemly incident that upsets a visiting Important Person, his father is fed to a dinosaur -- as an object lesson in politeness -- and his remaining family are sold into slavery. For sixteen years Kerryl has plotted his revenge. Now, with the aid of a beautiful noblewoman, a time machine, a race of aliens who use the Mesozoic Era of Earth as a setting for adventure videos, and a stampede of ravaging dinosaurs, Kerryl gets his chance to even the interstellar score. But first he has to escape from several death sentences. . . . In fact, he must come back from the dead! ""Space opera took a unique form in the hands of Jack Vance, as he transformed two-fisted swash-buckling to an artistry of pungent, subtle ironies. . . .

George Orwell,“1984”,"George Orwell’s 1984 takes on new life with extraordinary relevance and renewed popularity. “Orwell saw, to his credit, that the act of falsifying reality is only secondarily a way of changing perceptions. It is, above all, a way of asserting power.”—The New Yorker In 1984, London is a grim city in the totalitarian state of Oceania where Big Brother is always watching you and the Thought Police can practically read your mind. Winston Smith is a man in grave danger for the simple reason that his memory still functions. Drawn into a forbidden love affair, Winston finds the courage to join a secret revolutionary organization called The Brotherhood, dedicated to the destruction of the Party. Together with his beloved Julia, he hazards his life in a deadly match against the powers that be. Lionel Trilling said of Orwell’s masterpiece, “1984 is a profound, terrifying, and wholly fascinating book. It is a fantasy of the political future, and like any such fantasy, serves its author as a magnifying device for an examination of the present.” Though the year 1984 now exists in the past, Orwell’s novel remains an urgent call for the individual willing to speak truth to power.",5,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,648,5472496430,fantascienza,/copertina libri/1984.jpg,30,È possibile estendere il prestito per altri 30 giorni.

George R. R. Martin,Fire and Blood,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The thrilling history of the Targaryens comes to life in this masterly work by the author of A Song of Ice and Fire, the inspiration for HBO’s Game of Thrones. Centuries before the events of A Game of Thrones, House Targaryen—the only family of dragonlords to survive the Doom of Valyria—took up residence on Dragonstone. Fire & Blood begins their tale with the legendary Aegon the Conqueror, creator of the Iron Throne, and goes on to recount the generations of Targaryens who fought to hold that iconic seat, all the way up to the civil war that nearly tore their dynasty apart. What really happened during the Dance of the Dragons? Why was it so deadly to visit Valyria after the Doom? What were Maegor the Cruel’s worst crimes? What was it like in Westeros when dragons ruled the skies? These are but a few of the questions answered in this essential chronicle, as related by a learned maester of the Citadel and featuring more than eighty all-new black-and-white illustrations by artist Doug Wheatley. Readers have glimpsed small parts of this narrative in such volumes as The World of Ice & Fire, but now, for the first time, the full tapestry of Targaryen history is revealed. With all the scope and grandeur of Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Fire & Blood is the the first volume of the definitive two-part history of the Targaryens, giving readers a whole new appreciation for the dynamic, often bloody, and always fascinating history of Westeros. Praise for Fire & Blood “I love it so much. Fire & Blood is Martin Unbound . . . and I couldn’t put it down. . . . There’s an addictive quality to the prose that’s outright gossipy. . . . The obvious comparison here is J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Silmarillion. . . . Writing centuries after the events he’s describing, the Gyldayn voice complicates this game of thrones with a clash of perspectives and a storm of debatable facts. . . . Heavy stuff, but Fire & Blood flies.”—Entertainment Weekly “A masterpiece of popular historical fiction.” —The Sunday Times “The saga is a rich and dark one, full of both the title’s promised elements. . . . It’s hard not to thrill to the descriptions of dragons engaging in airborne combat, or the dilemma of whether defeated rulers should ‘bend the knee,’ ‘take the black’ and join the Night’s Watch, or simply meet an inventive and horrible end.”—The Guardian",5,Bantam,736,1524796298,fantasy,/copertina libri/FireAndBlood.jpg,30,È possibile estendere il prestito per altri 30 giorni.
Terry Brooks,First King of Shannara,"BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Terry Brooks's The Measure of the Magic. Horrified by the misuse of magic they had witnessed during the First War of the Races, the Druids at Paranor devoted themselves to the study of the old sciences, from the period before the collapse of civilization a thousand years before. Only the Bremen and a few trusted associates still studied the arcane arts. And for his persistence, Bremen found himself outcast, avoided by all but the few free-thinkers among the Druids. But his removal from Paranor was not altogether a terrible thing, for Bremen learned that dark forces were on the move from the Northlands. That seemingly invincible armies of trolls were fast conquering all that lay to their south. That the scouts for the army--and its principal assassins--were Skull Bearers, disfigured and transformed Druids who had fallen prey to the seductions of the magic arts. And that at the heart of the evil tide was an archmage and former Druid named Brona! Using the special skills he had acquired through his own study of Magic, Bremen was able to penetrate the huge camp of the Troll army and learn many of its secrets. And he immediately understood that if the peoples of the Four Lands were to escape eternal subjugation they would need to unite. But, even united, they would need a weapon, something so powerful that the evil magic of Brona, the Warlock Lord, would fail before its might...",5,Del Rey,448,345444639,fantasy,/copertina libri/FirstKingOfShannara.jpg,30,È possibile estendere il prestito per altri 30 giorni.

Thirty-year-old Helen Clarvoe is scared and all alone. The heiress of a small fortune, she is resented by her mother and, to a lesser degree, her brother. The only person who seemingly cares for her is the family’s attorney, Paul Blackshear. A shut-in, Helen maintains her residence in an upscale hotel downtown. But passive-aggressive resentment isn’t the only thing hounding Helen Clarvoe. A string of bizarre and sometimes threatening prank phone calls has upended her spinster’s routine. Increasingly threatened, she turns to a reluctant Mr. Blackshear to get to the bottom of these strange calls. Blackshear is doubtful of their seriousness but he quickly realizes that he is in the midst of something far more sinister than he thought possible. As he unravels the mystery of the calls the identity behind them slowly emerges, predatory and treacherous.",5,Soho Press,170,1681990121,giallo,/copertina libri/BeastinView.jpg,30,È possibile estendere il prestito per altri 30 giorni.

Lois Wille,At Home in the Loop,"Lois Wille’s illustrated account provides behind-the-scenes insight into how a small number of Chicago business leaders transformed the dangerous and seedy South Loop into an integrated and thriving community in the heart of the central city. The obstacles to the evolution of Dearborn Park were quite formidable, including a succession of six mayors, huge economic impediments, policy disputes engendered among people used to making their own corporate decisions, the wretched reputation of the South Loop, problems with the Chicago public school system, and public mistrust of a project supported by the wealthy, no matter how altruistic the goal. It took twenty years and millions of dollars, but it will pay off and in fact is paying off right now. With Dearborn Park, Chicago left a formula that other cities can use to turn fallow land into vibrant neighborhoods—without big government subsidies. As Wille explains, the realization of this vision requires shared investment and shared risk on the part of local businesses, financial institutions, and government. It links private and public influence and capital. Wille explains how these elements worked together to build a neighborhood in a blighted tract of Chicago’s Loop. She also describes how key decisions affecting the public interest were made during a time of profound change in the city’s political life: Dearborn Park was conceived during the final years of the most powerful political machine in America and had to adapt as that machine crumbled and city government was reshaped",5,SIU Press,233,8093221250,comico,/copertina libri/AtHomeInTheLoop.jpg,30,È possibile estendere il prestito per altri 30 giorni.
John Kenneth Muir,Best in Show,"(Applause Books). Best in Show is the first in-depth look at the method behind film director and actor Christopher Guest's madness and genius. John Kenneth Muir focuses his attention on the acclaimed Guest-directed trilogy of what some call ""mockumentaries"": Waiting for Guffman , Best in Show and A Mighty Wind . In these films Guest has escorted rapt audiences into the purportedly real worlds of a small-town theatrical company, dog show competition, and folk music festival. Muir also details the events that lead to Rob Reiner's influential and legendary This Is Spinal Tap , which Rolling Stone called the best rock and roll movie of all time, and in which Guest played the part of guitarist Nigel Tufnel. Much of Best in Show exemplifies the unique process by which Guest directs films. He employs a common repertory company, improvises scenes often without any rehearsal, and does not use any screenplay with dialogue, instead following a detailed outline often co-authored with his ace actor/writer Eugene Levy. Company members that have been interviewed for this book include Fred Willard, Harry Shearer, Bob Balaban and Michael Hitchcock. Guest's influences Saturday Night Live , National Lampoon as well as his more conventional comedies, such as The Big Picture and Almost Heroes , are studied. Best in Show is general enough to bring new fans to the table, yet detailed enough to satisfy the most in-the-know Guest fan and film student. A complete filmography with Guest's directing, acting and writing credits is included, as is the appendix, ""You Know You're in a Christopher Guest Film When ..."" Guest once commented, ""I am drawn to people who have dreams that are slightly out of reach.""

If your life was all you had to give, how could you not give it? If it was someone you truly loved?
